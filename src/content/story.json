        "The concept for The School of Contemplative Life first arose three years ago, following much enthusiasm and support from spiritual leaders and members of the community.  A physical home will be sought to house the School in due course.",
        "Until that time, our energy is focused on delivering a programme of teaching and practice to help people become places of peace in the world and live in greater harmony with each other."
