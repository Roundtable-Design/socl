    <h3>Personal data</h3>
    <p>
      ‘Personal data’ is any information that relates to a living, identifiable
      person. This will usually include your name, address, contact details, and
      other information we collect as part of our relationship with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      That information can also include ‘special categories’ of data, which is
      the official term for information about a person’s race or ethnic origin,
      religious, political or other beliefs, physical or mental health, trade
      union membership, genetic or biometric data, sex life or sexual
      orientation. The use of this type of data, and of information about
      criminal convictions and offences, is subject to strict legal controls and
      we do not foresee collecting or using any of that type of data about you.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are committed to protecting your privacy and all of your personal data.
      We only process data if we need to for a specific purpose, as explained
      below. Most often, we collect your personal directly from you, through our
      contact with you.
    </p>
    <h3>Your data and how and why we process it</h3>
    <p>
      Our data processing is so we can manage and support our relationship with
      you, comply with legal obligations, improve our services and achieve our
      legitimate business aims. The information below gives more details about
      our purposes for processing data, and the legal basis for each type of
      processing.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most
      commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Where you consent to us using your personal data, for example when you
        correspond with us or request notifications of our activity (your
        consent can be withdrawn by you at any time as set out in this policy);
      </li>
      <li>
        Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third
        party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those
        interests;
      </li>
      <li>Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you contact the School over email, phone, or social media with comments
      or queries, we will use your contact details to be able to communicate
      with you, based on the legitimate interests of both the School and
      yourself to answer your comments or queries.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not normally need to collect or process any of your ‘special
      category data’, which would be health, ethnicity, religion and other
      similarly sensitive information.
    </p>

    <h3>Third parties</h3>
    <p>
      We do not share your personal data with any external third parties. Where
      we need to share your personal data, we will obtain your express opt-in
      consent before we share it.
    </p>
    <h3>How and where we store your data</h3>
    <p>
      Your personal data is held securely in electronic formats. We store
      personal data in and transfer it only where it can be expected to be
      protected and where we can provide appropriate safeguards for your data
      and your rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of our Data Processors process data in the USA, and we have signed up
      to appropriate Standard Contract Clauses in order to provide appropriate
      safeguards for your data.
    </p>
    <h3>How long we keep your data</h3>
    <p>
      Some of our retention periods are based on legal requirements, and others
      are based on the practical reasons we need to keep the data for a certain
      period of time.{" "}
    </p>
    <p>
      Once we reach the retention period, we will securely delete the relevant
      data, unless we are legally required to keep it longer, or there are legal
      reasons why we should keep it longer.
    </p>
